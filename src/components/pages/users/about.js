                        Technology can be used in many ways, but it's best used to help people. This can be at the global level, or it can be used to make a difference right outside your door!<br/> For example, you may have seen people sleeping in the streets, a single mother struggling to carry a new piece of furniture up the stairs, or someone whose car broke down, so now they can't get to work for a month.
